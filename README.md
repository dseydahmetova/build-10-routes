# build-10-routes

## Instructions
Build 10 Routes and a view engine, say anything you want
Make at least 2 different views, and use them both in different routes


### Bonus
Dynamically add links to your view engine so you can make anchor tags to link your pages together


### Super Bonus
Create a route and view dedicated to displaying a single data resource, such as a single student.

We refer to this as the showroute/view, vs. the indexroute/view.

The key to implementing this feature is route parameters documented in the Route parameters section of the Express Routing guideLinks to an external site..

Basically, you can define a route as follows:

`// have some object with a bunch of students`
`// edit your view engine as needed and don't copy this code`
`// word for word, bar for bar, its just an idea`

app.get('/students/:id', function(req, res) {
  console.log(`The value for the :id route parameter is: ${req.params.id}`);
  res.render('students/show', { studentId: req.params.id, studentName: studentsObject[req.params.id].name });
  });

To send a matching route from the browser, you can use an html a tag that generates a hyperlink that looks like:

`<a href="/students/ ##studentId##">`
 ` Click for Details for Student ##studentName##>`
`</a>`
